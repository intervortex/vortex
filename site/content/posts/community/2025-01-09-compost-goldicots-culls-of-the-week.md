If you think about it, the idea of “atmospheric black metal” is terrifying and sickening, to be ensconced in an omnipresent pervasive evil, breathing in and out when the air itself is hateful. Better to hope then the name refers to the spheres, of dwelling under a celestial lid of menace, the earth lit by dark stars. That’s what Serpent’s Order sounds like, a majestic atmosphere of darkness and horror, punctuating grim reality with haunting omen and soaring vulture. Entangled in Warped Torrents is a busy album, fresh hells on every track, with commanding voice, wrenched from a hoary throat, an endless sense of dread, and the classic interlude: steel against steel, ringing in the field. Breathe in and hold…

**2 -** DIM - *Dark Age Decadence*

A rich blend of dungeon synth, dark ambient, folk, electronica, and depressive black metal, DIM surpasses the multiplicity of their dissected labels into a complex and earnest album, each genre a different perspective on an effervescent whole. Perhaps most interesting is the eerie warmth brought out from this experiment; rather than the normal cold and dark feelings of this scene, Dark Age Decadence is warm and dark, to spend a  meditative yet adventurous night with. This is the most interesting release of the week.

1 -** Old Nick - *The “Where Poison Apples Grow” EP*

Nurturing the idiosyncrasy up from the germ of an idea into a fully realized work of art takes time, patience, and a lot of care. Old Nick applies that tender love to each and every riff, developing ostensibly silly nonsense into beautiful arrangements of unique expression. Listen to how every phrase in the title opener ends in a different way, whether the toll of a bell, a death grunt, an acoustic breakbeat, or all three in an exciting and unpredictable stack. 

Listen to “The Hat Man” and its unexpected xylophone counterpoint and spooky synth stab accents, all cleverly syncopated and alternated to bring out a palpable sense of nighttime skulking and sneaking. Even on its most traditional track, “Apple Dolls of the Lonely Witch”, the structure is aptly designed around a beautifully tragic poem, bearing fruit of a surprisingly serious nature, such that a style seemingly so absurd is now perfect in its pulling of the heartstrings. Old Nick (and Grime Stone’s writing throughout) is excellent, meaningful, and even here, on apparent goofy ephemera, profound. How many songs can claim a chorus as crushing and catchy as “Tears of a Crying Wolf”, and match pounding hardstyle techno to the lycanthropic plight and romantic black metal to melancholic evil? 

Throughout all Grime Stone Records, and no less focused and ornate here, there is an exceptional attention to detail, a thematic correspondence between timbre, lyric, genre, riff, aesthetic and tone. This release celebrates five years of GSR’s brand of haunt’d witch’ry – here’s to another five. L-L-L-LET’S FUCKING GO
