*First review by Tarbeaux*

With a name like this I wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t give a serious shot at this release. You would expect some dumb slam, slimmy vox, D-tune guitars, a large load of chugs and a drums sounding like a tin can. But you couldn’t be more wrong, because instead we got a melodeath banger, full of pummeling riffs, furious drums and technical leads. The use of two distinctive voices, one for the screams and one for the growls reminds their Japanese comparse Intestine Baalism, but with a bit more grindcore focus. Add some Power Metal elements and chiptune for the variety, and you got one of the very few fresh takes on the genre, while avoiding to be too gimmicky. The album is solidly built on a very serious and effective melodeath base, that I think shine the most on the most melodic songs, like the subtly named Hate Fuck or the impressive Slave Humiliation. Although with a length of only 28 minutes, They never make the mistake of running their songs for too long, and manages to pack them with so many riffs that will make you thrust your head back and forth a lot. It’s true the production could be better, but it’s not horrible by any means, and doesn't alter my enjoyment of the album. Straight to the point, effective, familiar but not distinctive, I can only encourage you to try Bloody Cumshot for yourself.

*Second review by ferday*

With a name like this, you can be sure you’ll get exactly the quality you expect.  Some dumb, caveman slam would have been preferable to this thoroughly average, barely legible copy of the Swedish greats. Every opportunity the band has to inject some variety is done as a gimmick, and it all contributes to the album being an inoffensive oddity rather than anything interesting or worth your time. For those who love their metal to be a copy of modern At the Gates, this album will tide you over until the ex-Gothenberg greats release their next mediocrity.

**5/10**

*Third review by Aker*

With a name like this, you know you’re going to leave the listening session feeling degraded and emotionally spent. Nymphomania is an obnoxious and cloying onrush of melodic noise that skitters, scrapes and spasms like a brain-dead melo-death zombie. There are tight moments of promise - a grinding spurt of gnarly aggression at the 50-second mark of “VOMITING THE BRAIN'' and a few more satisfying surges throughout - but for the most part Bloody Cumshot shit out strings of loose, scruffy lead guitar melodies with hopelessly uninspiring rhythmic patterns grooving aimlessly beneath. Symphonic elements attempt to add a layer of grandeur but Bloody Cumshot’s application is shoddy and corny. This is a record that shows off its tricks boorishly, a snotty child pushing in front of the TV to show off its cheap, shiny toy. This is metal for 4chan/Discord memers and edgy cosplayers. This is a shitpost. The record sounds shit, too. Drums, drowned, click-clack and add little dynamism; the chunked rhythmic riffs are sterile and flat; the dual vocal approach is annoying.  Perhaps I am being harsh and perhaps I am wrong - I hate most symphonic/neoclassical/power tinged extreme metal which, by default, makes me prejudiced. Also, “TRUE HUMANITY” is a very good song that feels complete rather than a string of irking ideas. Perhaps, however, I am right and this record does suck. Wait - I am right. I am always right. Aker out. 

**4/10**
