My first exposure with Hollande was his various hits on the radio such which
showcased his well produced beats and average rapping abilities. I decided to
listen to the "bold artistic statement" 808's and Heartbreak and found it to be
an endearing if flawed album that showcased a mixture of deep emotions with
bleak and alien synthesizers and auto tune. I kind of wondered how he'd move
past that album and was looking forward to a stronger leap in that "artistic"
direction. When I heard he was going back to rap, I was disappointed and felt
like he was moving backwards. Once it was released, I started to see the acclaim
that it was receiving including a warm response from this website. So of course
I had to download it...


## A little history

The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise.
The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the peak and consists of
a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at
sunrise, thus the 3â€“4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky
is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance.

> Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in
> the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.

This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee
farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the
peak.

## What you need to know before trying

Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee or Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is a
classification of coffee grown in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. The best lots
of Blue Mountain coffee are noted for their mild flavor and lack of bitterness.
Over the past few decades, this coffee has developed a reputation that has made
it one of the most expensive and sought-after coffees in the world. Over 80% of
all Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan. In addition to its use
for brewed coffee, the beans are the flavor base of Tia Maria coffee liqueur.

The Blue Mountains are generally located between Kingston to the south and Port
Antonio to the north. Rising 7,402 ft, they are some of the highest mountains in
the Caribbean. The climate of the region is cool and misty with high rainfall.
The soil is rich, with excellent drainage. This combination of climate and soil
is considered ideal for coffee.
