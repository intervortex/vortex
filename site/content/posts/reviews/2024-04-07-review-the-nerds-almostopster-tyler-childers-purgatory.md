*E﻿ditor's note : I think The Nerd is at war with himself, who knows really what's going on in his head, but this is what he had to say first (read this with the voice of Hank Hill from King of the Hill)*

I ain’t writing no fucking review, far more talented people than me have written about this album so go look them up. Or don’t, I’m The Nërd, not The Cöp. However I will write a quick blurb for this here website. And Bless your heart. Now enough talking like a hick, let’s listen to some hick music instead.

*E﻿ditor's note : The following review has been reworked a bit for comprehension purposes. The Nerd will probably not realize it because he is too busy complaining about his neighbors.*

I love heavy metal, it’s by far the most diverse and enigmatic of all the music genres. However metal fans tend to be far more elitist towards their preferred music style. I can attest to this behavior because I used to be one of them. But in 2015 everything changed when I encountered an individual on a metal forum who was….very limited (.) in his musical choices. I took a good look at his close minded attitude and realized I didn't want to emulate that and end up like him. So starting in 2016 I started listening to a genre I had always tended to avoid at the time: Country.

Coming from the hick capital of Canada, I have always been surrounded by country music. Whether it was the soothing gospel style of Johnny Cash or the energetic and barely coherent ramblings of Willie Nelson there was always a country song in the background of my childhood. However, when the 2000s arrived, I discovered heavy metal and swiftly veered away from Country altogether. It wasn't until many years later, and thanks to the old opinionated man on this forum, that I decided to give a fresh wave of country artists a chance, and it was through the music of Tyler Childers that I found myself drawn back to the genre.

Tyler Childers' debut album, "Purgatory," remains his best work to this day. With its blend of throwback country and blood grass outlaw twang, Childers stunned me back in the day from the moment I first heard it. In an era where mainstream "country" often meant acts like Florida Georgia Line (barf) (*Editor's note: Who?*), "Purgatory" felt like a breath of fresh air. Standout tracks like "Feathered Indians" and the slow-burning "Tattoo" possess an infectious quality that will have you humming them all day long.

Unfortunately, the bluegrass outlaw vibe that I enjoy a lot never seems to stick around long enough to make the album as cohesive as it should be, leaving the album somewhat disjointed. Some tracks also overstay their welcome, songs such as “Banded Clovis” and “Honky Tonk Flame” could be perfect gems but end up liggering for too long. It’s the same kind of disappointing feeling as thinking you are taking a perfect shit but still ending up wiping for 5 minutes after it.

Ultimately, I found myself outgrowing this album. While it served as my initial reintroduction to the genre, over time, as I discovered newer and better albums, its original freshness began to wane. As the years passed, the album's shortcomings became more apparent, overshadowing its initial allure. Verdict 8.5/10 

*Editor's note: the nerd added this at the end:*

Also seeing a bunch of Euros and Aussies having to listen to a country album makes me smile. Enjoy Fuckers.
