Heavy Metal is a genre that is so associated with the 80’s, that has been played by so many bands, with so many different iterations, where so many great albums emerged; it leaves the impression that it’s impossible to be creative anymore in that style, in particular in 2021.  It’s probably the reason that a lot of new albums, or new heavy metal bands, are either a simulacrum of that period or just a plain copy. A simulacrum because some bands really try hard to make their music stand by themselves as being modern and actual, while hiding their influence, for example Ghost or Eternal Champion.  Plato said that a simulacrum is intentionally distorted in order to make the copy appear correct to viewers; and it’s hard to blame those bands to do that as the source material is now completely dry, and is part of history now. It’s not necessary a bad thing, I’m, myself, a pretty big fan of Ghost, but ultimately when you start digging the original influences, it feels more and more like a modern homage to some of those historic band (Blue Oyster Cult, Witchfinder General, Cirith Ungol or Manilla Road, depending) than true novelty. On the other hand, you have just the straight copy, driven by nostalgia from a period that some of those bands never experienced, or from an old iconic band trying to recreate the magic from their glorious days; I’m thinking Judas Priest – Firepower. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, being original will not make you automatically better (if only…), and who am I to whine if people have fun with those, it’s not like I have to listen to every time they start popping up near the top of a rate aggregator, right?  But still as a young heavy metal fan, that never lived the golden age, I can only wish to be surprised by something innovative, that assumes it’s roots but still try to bring new ideas on the table, while not being completely experimental or wacky.

So how do you achieve that? Well, let’s find out with the band that I’m going to review today, Dream Tröll and their new album The Realm of the Tormentör



So now that this pedantic introduction made by an asshole that doesn't master any of the notions he mentioned up there is over; it’s time for fun! The first time I heard about Dream Tröll was with their concept EP The Witch’s Curse 3 years ago, that I think laid the base of the style that will be developed on the next two albums.

In my opinion, Dream Tröll music is all about being seriously fun. By that I mean it’s not trying to humour you by being silly, or trying to be a parody, it’s just entertaining by being effective, catchy and let’s be honest, quite cheesy too. But they are aware of that and play with it very well; for me the best example is the sounds of the lead guitars, the first time I heard them I thought it was synthesizer, I never heard something like that before. It’s like a hijack of the classical cheesy synth you can find in power metal, but used in such an innovative way that it feels quite refreshing and brings a distinctiveness to their music that make it instantly recognizable. It’s not the same old cheese that now has some molds of it anymore, it’s a brand new one. On the new album, I think the song Watch It Burn show that pretty well.

Those leads alternate with some simple but effective riff, that on this album, I thought were sometimes inspired by glam metal, like on She Got the Devil Inside. I want to talk about the production too, because on every album, I found it to be pretty suited to the style of the music, modern but not too brick walled, with the rhythmic guitars really having a tone more aggressive that you would expect for heavy metal. The bass is always very upfront and quite meaty, adding a solid groove to those songs, which is again a very recognizable aspect of their sound.   But still, I kind of wish to see them having access to a more professional set up to refine their sound to something top notch, because it feels a bit flat sometimes. It might be the band that wants to stay independent, and now labels are not as useful as they were in the past, with all the streaming services, but I think they deserve more recognition, a greater success, and I wish them to be able to develop their sound even more. I don’t know why something like Metal Blades or Cruz Del Sur didn’t try to sign them already; ultimately, I just hope they will be able to keep making music.

Back to the music now and it’s time to talk about vocals. I always thought that Dream Tröll music was relying a lot on the melody of the vox to achieve the catchiness of their songs. I was saddened to learn that the vocalist from the previous album and the EP left, as I thought he had a dramatic way of delivering his cheesy line, with such a conviction that again it really strengthens the serious aspect while being so fun and entertaining. And I wasn’t sure if they could manage to find someone else fitted for the job. But I think they did it, the new vocalist is not as dramatic but has a more varied range with high notes here and there, which add a bit more variation, quite fitted to this album.

My favourite track of the album is the opener, The Tormentor, that I think really embodied the main ideas that make the base of Dream Tröll sound. Effective, catchy and dramatic chorus, epic leads, memorable break, and that goes right to the point. Those statements can be said to most of the shortest songs of this album. But I must say that the longest songs weren’t as enjoyable, while Dream Tröll is quite used to write some very effective long songs (the whole The Witch’s Curse EP, Chrome Skull Viper or Darkness Lies Within the Sun) I found here they were a bit repetitive, especially the closer that builds, builds and keep on building to a pretty underwhelming final. Despite those criticisms, I have so much fun listening to this album, singing along and headbanging that my enjoyment is still very high.

 

By having a unique sound, a suited production, a good approach to the genre and by being incredibly catchy, Dream Tröll manage to be one of the rare bands that make an original and modern Heavy Metal, along with the like of Satan, Hammers of Misfortune or Slough Feg, each of them in their particular style. I can only wish more people knew about this band, and hope to see them at a show one day. Long live Rock n Tröll!
