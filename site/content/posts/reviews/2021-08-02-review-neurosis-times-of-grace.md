You’re sitting by the doorway, looking at the land surrounding you. All is in decay. The crops are dying under the burning sun, everything is dry and desolate. But you see them coming, dark clouds looming at the horizon. They grow, swelling again and again, darkening the sky. Lightning strikes and rain is released on this desolate wasteland. You welcome the storm, regenerational for the bodies and the soil. Then it slowly stops and everything seems good for a while. But suddenly it starts again, with immense violence, and you realize: it’s a great flood, sweeping everything away and sinking everything in the deep and dark water.

Neurosis was formed in 1985 by guitarist and singer Scott Kelly, bassist Dave Edwardson and Drummer Jason Roeder; all of whom are still current members of the band without interruption since. Coming from Oakland, they started as a crust band then switched to heavier and slower sludge with the inclusion of keyboards and noise samples, as second guitarist Steve Von Till joined in 1989. During a 36 year span, Neurosis’ line up remained very stable, which could explain the continuity and coherence in their discography - maturing and perfecting their recognizable sounds first, then starting more experimentation and variation on this solid base. 



Times of Grace is at the beginning of this more experimental era while still having the density of its predecessor Through Silver and Blood. It’s also more atmospheric, easier to listen to and more rewarding. The production by Steve Albini is partly behind that change of direction, away from the dark and claustrophobic production of its predecessor, to something more open and balanced. No instrument overshadows any other and the music feels like a coherent block that hauls in the same direction. Yet, it is also a guitar focused album, with a guitar sound that gives so much strength to the riffs. It's an album that you can and need to listen to loudly.

Neurosis are masters at building tension. Most songs follow a similar dynamic with build up leading to a massive riff. It’s all about progression on a musical pattern that puts different layers on it, which avoids the feeling of meaningless repetition. Listening to this album demands patience. Much like a looming storm, Times of Grace patiently builds and approaches before unleashing itself on the listener, in all its might. A very heavy storm, it hammers you relentlessly with songs like “Under the Surface” and “End of the Harvest”. The storm eases away on slower and more atmospheric songs like “Belief” and “Away”. 



The calmer sections can almost feel minimalist sometimes (see: “Exist”), but those sections bring a lot of subtlety and emotion. In previous albums, Neurosis had the tendency to overuse interludes, with a lot of random noise, urban recording, etc. Here there is none of that. There is still faff, but the album is much more focused in comparison to Through Silver and Blood or Souls at Zero. The interludes actually serve the album by bringing in other themes, in particular on the surprising “Descent”, adding a bit more variety to the album. Despite its length, I never get bored by this album because each song can justify its duration.



The term “neurosis” itself is an unusual psychological term used to characterize any behaviour related to OCD, anxiety, depression, low-self worth or any symptoms related to the dissatisfaction and helplessness to reach a fulfilled and meaningful life. Neurosis’ music embodies the definition, sounding like it comes from someone in pain, twisted by an interior rage that sweats through every pore of their skin. The hoarse voice of Scott Kelly has a very emotional side to it; it’s always on the verge of collapse but still extremely powerful. Scott Kelly remarked in 2000 (at the time the album was released):



“Everything that you've ever seen of [Neurosis](http://www.ram.org/music/reviews/neurosis.html) was born of our sweat and blood. Don't fucking forget it. When all of your heroes turn to mainstream shit, we'll still be standing because we refuse to lose.”



It’s easy to see how Neurosis is a cathartic experience to fight, or at least not to yield, against the very symptoms that the band’s name represents. I think that’s how a majority of people enjoy Neurosis’ music, through it’s cathartic aspect and the way it puts you in a transcendental state. The lyrics are often ambiguous, left to the listener's interpretation, although their introspective and psychological aspects are dominant. On Times of Grace, the red string tying the album together is "flow"; flow of blood, water, or time, and the listener is invited to reflect on how this impacts them. Is the flow guiding us to salvation or decay? Should we go with the flow or against it?

If you enjoy this album, I strongly suggest you listen to the other Neurosis albums, with the exception of the first two. You’ll find other albums either more atmospheric and melodic or more crushing and heavy, whilst maintaining the same vibe and characteristic sound.



I should also mention the companion of Times of Grace. At the same time, Neurosis' side project Tribute of Neurot released an album called Grace. This is what the band has to say about the project:\
\
"This recording by Tribes of Neurot is the companion disc to the Neurosis Times of Grace CD. Grace is sonically designed to be played simultaneously with the Neurosis disc. Alone, it possesses the same dynamic flow, fundamental texture and emotional impact as Times of Grace. Played together, these recordings create a unique multi-dimensional sound experience."

I’ll let you judge the experience and if it’s worth it. I personally have not played the albums simultaneously yet, so for the velocitopster, just listen to Times of Grace.



I don’t listen to this album often. Everytime it needs to be a special moment, I need to take the time, like facing a steep climb, where you just have to sweat through it. I just want to be swept up by the mood of this album every time, and sink under its force, to be washed anew.
