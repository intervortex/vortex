During a year of grey, music - like days - mushed into a fatberg of formless
joylessness. Futures: rotted. Cities once filled with mask less swine emptied
for the greater good, so it goes. Enter Alphaville: a decadent beacon, an ornate
art-deco tower, opulent amongst the tangled urban webs beneath. Alphaville
arrived at the perfect time and continued to stand tall as a glistening triumph
of avant-garde black metal. It's a record that turned up the theatrics and
stagecraft by infinity. The music - be it the bounteous basslines, the diverse
vocal transformations, the fluid transitions - managed, somehow, to satisfy the
grand dystopian concept of luxurious atomic decimation. Few bands are able to
create such intricate and alluring worlds: Imperial Triumphant can.


## Let's dive right in

The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a
conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer
flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper
than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most
of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee
brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex
coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing
compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:

1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.
2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.
3. Never skip preheating the glass.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden
collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot
water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass
neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The
pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape
of the conical glass.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and
precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature
of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive
feature of its appearance.
