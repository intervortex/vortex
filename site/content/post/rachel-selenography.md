Rachel's formed in 1991 by Jason Noble (guitarist for hardcore band Rodan) who
promptly recruited violist Christian Frederickson and semi famous pianist Rachel
Grimes. in '95 they released *Handwriting*, which at the time (the normalisation
stage of post rock) was unique for combining guitar based post rock tropes with
minimalist classical composition and a variety of normal and not-so-normal
instruments. Through the 90's they released a string of experimental and
sometimes spotty albums, with the number of guest musos and the density of
instrumentation getting higher each release.

a not-so-young-anymore ferday was just getting in to the post rock scene in the
late 90's after a few years of uni had really jacked up my pretension, and
*Selenography* was the first Rachel's release i heard, from a friend at the
local college radio station that i did some stuff with. for this one, they
returned to a much simpler sound and essentially this is pure early-scene post
rock played through the lens (and on the instruments of) minimalist chamber
classical. There are a few minor bells and whistles which add to the variety but
it never overreaches and always maintains the dreamy atmosphere. overall this is
the most cohesive vision Rachel's ever achieved and by extension, the best album
of the sub-niche.

when i first heard it i liked it but didn't immediately fall in love. i just
listened to the record so many times it has become part of my personal canon,
rather than the album having been defined by any external event or other such
flights of youthful fancy, and listening to a record a hundred+ times in two
decades and not getting even a little tired of it seems like a pretty good
justification. more boring than cool anecdotes for sure, but also easier to
write about and much easier to be honest about, so yes i took the safe route but
you made me go first.

and it's a truly great album so listen to it!
